        <h3>From today's featured article</h3>
        <p><a href="#">Master Chief</a> is a major character in the <a href="#">Halo</a> multimedia franchise. First appearing in the 2001 video game <a href="#">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, he is the playable character and protagonist of many of the games in the franchise, and makes additional appearances in spin-offs, novels, and comics. In the story, Master Chief is abducted as a child and raised by the military to fight against human rebels. He and his fellow <a href="#">Spartan supersoldiers</a> instead become humanity's best weapon in the fight against a genocidal collective of alien races known as the <a href="#">Covenant</a>. The character is voiced by <a href="#">Steve Downes</a>. Master Chief was originally designed to be a faceless avatar whom players could inhabit while playing the games, but the relationship between him and his artificial intelligence companion <a href="#">Cortana</a> has become a central part of the franchise. Master Chief serves as a mascot for the <a href="#">Xbox</a> brand, and has been described as an iconic character in gaming culture. (<a href="#">Full article...</a>)</p>
