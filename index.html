            <p class="card-text"><a href="#">Master Chief</a> is a major character in the <a href="#">Halo</a> multimedia franchise. First appearing in the 2001 video game <a href="#">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, he is the playable character and protagonist of many of the games in the franchise, and makes additional appearances in spin-offs, novels, and comics. In the story, Master Chief is abducted as a child and raised by the military to fight against human rebels. He and his fellow <a href="#">Spartan supersoldiers</a> instead become humanity's best weapon in the fight against a genocidal collective of alien races known as the <a href="#">Covenant</a>. The character is voiced by <a href="#">Steve Downes</a>. Master Chief was originally designed to be a faceless avatar whom players could inhabit while playing the games, but the relationship between him and his artificial intelligence companion <a href="#">Cortana</a> has become a central part of the franchise. Master Chief serves as a mascot for the <a href="#">Xbox</a> brand, and has been described as an iconic character in gaming culture. (<a href="#">Full article...</a>)</p>

            <p class="card-text"> <a href="#" >Wheat fields</a> were a fascination of <a href="#">Vincent van Gogh</a>, and this 1889 work, <span class="italic">Landscape from Saint-Remy</span>, is one of many oil-on-canvas paintings that included them. From his studio room at the <a href="#">Saint-Paul asylum</a>in <a href="#">Saint-Rémy-de-Provence</a>, southern France, Van Gogh worked on a group of paintings of the view from his window. During his stay, he made about twelve paintings showing the enclosed wheat field and the distant mountains in varying aspects. In this series, he expresses through symbolism and use of colour his deeply felt spiritual beliefs, appreciation of manual labourers and connection to nature. This painting is now part of the collection of the <a href="#"> Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek</a> in <a href="#">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark.</p>
